This repository contains code for my Master's thesis on spectral clustering at Imperial College London.

Here are the branches that contain the code described in the project:

1. gibbs - code for the gibbs sampler

2. after_everything_works & after_everything_works_weighted - code for synthetic dataset for the unweighted and weighted variational inference model.

3. italy_gov_data_for_thesis & weighted_itay_gov_data_for_thesis - code to run algorithm on the Italian government dataset
